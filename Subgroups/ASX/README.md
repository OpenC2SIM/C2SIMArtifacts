# C2SIM Autonomous Systems Extension - ASX
## Subgroup working artifacts

SISO’s C2SIM ASX sub-group engaged in developing an extension to the core C2SIM data model, specifying information interchange across robotic and autonomous systems (RAS). 

Current content includes:

1. [Contributed scenarios](./ContributedScenarios/) - The sub-group is currently collecting requirements, applying a scenario-based approach outlined in SISO’s Guidelines for Scenario Development (GSD). 

1. [Large Language Model experiments](./LLMExperiments/) - The group is investigating the capabilities of AI tools to facilitate crafting of scenarios, most specifically exploring to what degree Large Language Models (LLMs) can contribute to the task.
