Brutzman, D.P., Fitzpatgrick, C.R. (2020) Creating Virtual Environments for Evaluating Human-Machine Teaming, Naval Postgraduate School Technical Report NPS-MV-20-001. https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1127315.pdf

This paper is primarily concerned with the main simulation objectives, with scenarios playing a minor part in the narrative. Some of that is still present in the extracted scenario, for example in the `Specific Goals` that are identified. These are broader concerns of the paper, rather than the scenario itself.

>## GPT-4 Results

>The analysis of the provided document unveils an exemplar mission within a military context focusing on the use of modeling, simulation, and autonomous systems to gain insights into various scenarios. The specific scenarios delineated in the document center on a hypothetical situation involving the defense of a small village, showcasing the interplay between human forces and autonomous vehicles against a hostile platoon.
>
>**Summary Narrative**:
>
>The overarching scenario involves the defense of a village model by Marine squads and various autonomous vehicles against an attacking hostile platoon. The operations take place on the Kilo 2 range at Camp Pendleton, CA, presenting a controlled environment for the scenarios. This setup facilitates a comparison across multiple variables, including time of day effects, player perspectives, and responses of unmanned systems to various stimuli. Four distinct scenarios are developed, each altering environmental conditions and viewpoints to derive comparative insights.
>
>**Specific Goals**:
>- *Illustrate Time of Day Effects*: Understanding how operations under different lighting conditions, including night and the use of flares for illumination, affect tactical decisions and outcomes.
>- *Explore Player Perspectives*: Comparing the operational understanding and tactical decisions from the views of various players, including Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV).
>- *Analyze Sensor Responses and Decision Logic*: Evaluating the responsiveness and decision-making frameworks of autonomous systems when reacting to stimuli under the various conditions of the scenarios.
>
>**Measures of Performance**:
>
>Success in these scenarios is measured by the qualitative and quantitative insights gained regarding:
>
>- The effectiveness of operations under varying environmental conditions.
>- The operational and strategic value provided by various autonomous systems and vehicles.
>- The decision-making and tactical responses stimulated by different stimuli and perspectives.
>
>**Detailed Scenario Steps**:
>- *Deployment and Setup*: Establishing the blue force (platoon-sized element with a UAS and two UGVs for ISR operations) and the red force (fire-team sized with small arms, without supporting arms or ISR assets).
>- *Scenario Variations*: Executing operations across four variations
>
>   a. Daytime operations viewed from the UAS. 
>
>   b. Daytime operations viewed from the UGV perspective. 
>
>   c. Nighttime operations viewed from the UAS with illumination for improved visibility. 
>
>   d. Nighttime operations as viewed from the UAS perspective with UGVs engaging the red force.
>
>**Building a Conceptual Model**:
>
>*Domain and Scope Identification*: Defense operations involving mixed human-autonomous teaming in a controlled environment.
>
>*Concept Identification*: Marine squads, autonomous vehicles (UAS, UGV), hostile platoon, environmental conditions, ISR operations, sensors, decision logic.

>*Hierarchy Definition*: At the top level are the operational forces (blue and red forces), followed by the systems they employ (UAS, UGV, small arms), and the environmental conditions (time of day, illumination).

>*Relationship Identification*: The blue force employs UAS and UGV for ISR to combat the red force; the scenarios' outcomes are affected by environmental conditions and perspectives.
>
>*Property Identification*: For UAS and UGV, properties include sensor capabilities, mobility, and engagement potential. For human forces, properties encompass tactical training, armament, and observational capacity.
>
>*Constraints/Rules Identification*: The operation is constrained by the availability of ISR assets, the lighting conditions, and the capabilities of autonomous systems to respond to stimuli
