# Example of summary where paper details overwhelm the scenarios

For illustrative purposes, we present the result of a single run, extracting a scenario from Corona & Biaginni [5], the primary benchmark used during prompt evolution. 

>## GPT-4 Results

>The document contains a detailed description of an operational scenario aimed at demonstrating and evaluating the capabilities of unmanned autonomous systems (UxS) in military operations, particularly in an urban setting. The scenario is developed to meet specific research and operational goals for the integration of UxS within command and control (C2) structures and to explore their effectiveness in complex environments. Here's the analysis based on the requirements:

>**Summary Narrative**:
>
>The scenario revolves around a mission to protect troops and civilian populations against hostile unmanned aerial systems (UxS) in an urban environment. A team of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) escorts a human platoon through a city while unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) conduct reconnaissance to identify threats. The UAVs and UGVs collaborate, employing both non-kinetic and kinetic countermeasures against identified threats in a tiered defense system. The scenario is designed to test and demonstrate various aspects of UxS integration, including autonomous decision-making at different levels of autonomy (LoAs), the effectiveness of mixed human-robot teams, and the operational utility of UxS in urban combat situations.

>**Specific Goals**:
>1.	Detection and identification of enemy robotic units using UAVs and sensors.
>2.	Augmentation of situational awareness with external decision-making tools.
>3.	Defense against enemy UxS using friendly UxS.
>4.	Employment of UxS in urban settings, covering both land and air domains.
>5.	Exploration of human-robot interaction across different LoAs.
>
>**Measures of Performance**:
>- Efficiency in detecting and identifying enemy UxS.
>- The effectiveness of mixed human-robot teams in urban reconnaissance and combat scenarios.
>- Level of situational awareness achieved.
>- The effectiveness of countermeasures deployed against enemy UxS.
>- The degree of autonomy demonstrated by UxS and its impact on mission success.
>
>**Detailed Scenario Steps**:
>1.	A Command Post receives mission orders and dispatches UAV and UGV teams with optimized routes.
>2.	UAVs conduct reconnaissance to identify threats while UGVs escort a human platoon.
>3.	UxS generate status reports and, upon detecting hostile units, produce observation reports suggesting further actions while awaiting human confirmation.
>4.	Upon receiving orders, UAVs exit the area via designated routes, and UGVs escort the human platoon out of the danger zone, employing jamming or firing based on the proximity of the threat.
