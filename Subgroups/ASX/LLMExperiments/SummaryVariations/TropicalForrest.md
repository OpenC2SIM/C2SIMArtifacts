# Variation example: new setting

In this example, using OpenAI's Playground interactive capabilities, the user prompts the model to "Change this to a tropical forest setting" after having produced a summary of the [Corona & Biaginni (2019) paper](../PaperSummaries/Corona&Biaginni2019.md). That current context is then adapted according to the prompt.

>An operational scenario was adjusted to support the goals of the R2CD2 prototype within a tropical forest environment, emphasizing the adaptability and efficacy of Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) and sensors in reconnaissance and defensive operations against enemy robotic units in nature-intensive, wooded areas. A team of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) navigates the dense foliage to escort a human platoon through the forest, while unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) fly above the canopy to conduct aerial surveillance, searching for threats amidst the trees. Upon detecting hostile drones camouflaged within the forest, UAVs communicate enemy positions to UGVs, initiating a multi-layered defensive strategy. This strategy employs a "jungle canopy protection bubble," where countermeasures escalate from non-kinetic (e.g., electronic jamming or net trapping) to kinetic means (e.g., targeted shooting) depending on how close the enemy drones encroach upon the unit.
