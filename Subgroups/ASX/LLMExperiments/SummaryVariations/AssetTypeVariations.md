# Variation example: asset types

In this example, using OpenAI's Playground interactive capabilities, the user prompts the model to `Use just UGVs` after having produced a variation of the [Corona & Biaginni (2019) paper](../PaperSummaries/Corona&Biaginni2019.md) that [changes the setting from `urban` to `tropical forrest`](./TropicalForrest.md). That already modified context is then adapted according to the prompt.

>**Summary Narrative** 
>
>The operational scenario has been further modified to exclusively utilize Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) within a tropical forest environment, aiming to underscore the potential and efficiency of ground-based autonomous systems in complex natural terrains. In this scenario, a team of UGVs, equipped with advanced navigation and reconnaissance capabilities, undertakes a mission to ensure the safety of a human platoon navigating through a dense tropical forest. These UGVs are tasked with both leading the platoon through challenging terrain and conducting continuous surveillance to identify hidden enemy robotic units. Upon encountering hostile forces camouflaged within the forest, the UGVs initiate a sophisticated defense protocol. This protocol employs a strategy tailored to forest conditions, where countermeasures escalate from non-kinetic means, such as electronic jamming and entrapment, to kinetic actions, such as precision shooting, depending on the proximity of the detected threats to the platoon.

>**Scenario Steps **
>
>*Initial Deployment*: A squad of UGVs, equipped with terrain-adaptive capabilities and advanced detection systems, leads a human platoon into the forest. 
>
>*Continuous Surveillance*: As the platoon progresses, UGVs conduct ongoing reconnaissance to identify potential threats hidden in the natural surroundings. 
>
>*Threat Identification*: Upon detecting camouflaged hostile drones or robotic units, UGVs assess threat levels and communicate findings to the human platoon leadership. 
>
>*Defensive Protocol Initiation*: Triggering a layered defense strategy, UGVs initially employ electronic jamming and other non-kinetic measures against distant threats. 
>
>*Defense Escalation*: Should threats approach closer, UGVs switch to kinetic measures, using precision shooting to neutralize the enemy, all while leveraging natural cover and terrain.
