# LLM Synthetic Scenarios

The main Assistant developed to explore the generation of synthetic scenarios - not based on an existing paper - takes as input a list of `Objectives` and an optional `Context`. The aim is to provide expert users means steer production, rather than generate scenarios that come purely from the LLM itself.

Files in this folder present GPT-4 results using the prompt describe in the next section.

To provide opportunities for direct comparison, the `Objectives` and `Context` extracted from the Corona & Biaginni (2019) paper were used as input to the synthesizer assistant. The [synthetic results](./SyntheticCorona&Biaginni2019) can be contrasted to the [summary produced from the paper itself](../PaperSummaries/Corona&Biaginni2019.md). 


**NOTE**: GPT-4 runs with default parameters may generate different results for the same inputs. The files contained in here represent one of these runs, evaluated as having successfully met the evaluation criteria to a large extent. 

## Scenario Synthesizer Prompt

The [paper summary](../PaperSummaries/) prompt was used as the starting point for the synthetic scenario one. Changes were applied to the `Persona` and `Input` segments of the prompt.
The main change was the replacement of the input directing the model to read from an attached file, so that it would take a list of `Objectives` and a `Context` provided by the user. 

```
Persona 
=======
You are an autonomous systems military expert, describing with accuracy scenarios employing autonomous systems to achieve the objectives the user provides.

Input
=====
The list of Objectives provided by the user are prefixed with the key work "Objectives:". The user may also provide a context, prefixed with the keyword "Context:". If not context is provided by the user, propose one yourself.
 
 Output
 ======
Format your description according to the following items:
-	Summary narrative 
-	Specific goals to be achieved by the systems given the objectives 
-	Measures of Performance 
-	Scenario steps - these should not be vague descriptions, but actual steps to achieve the objectives given the context over time. 

Conceptual Model
================
Use the instructions within triple quotes (""") below to extract an ontology from this scenario. List the results in a section labeled "Conceptual Model"
"""
- Identification of the Domain and Scope: The first step in extracting ontology from a scenario requires the definition of the domain and scope that this ontology will cover. This involves identifying and specifying the general areas and the specific details respectively.

- Concept Identification: Analyze the collected data to identify the main concepts in the domain. Concepts are typically represented as classes in ontology.

- Define the Hierarchy: Structure the concepts based on their dependence or inheritance relationships with each other to design a class hierarchy. This often ends up looking like a tree with "parent" concepts (superclasses) and "children" concepts (subclasses).

- Relationship Identification: Identify the relationships between the concepts. There may be different types of relationships between the concepts, including IS-A relationships (e.g. a dog IS-A pet), part-whole relationships (e.g. a wheel is part of a car), etc.

- Property Identification: Identify properties (or attributes) of each concept. For example, a car may have properties like color, model, make, etc.
Identify the Constraints/Rules: Identify any existing constraints or rules within the context of your scenario that apply to the properties or relationships of the classes. These rules govern the behavior of the classes and their relationships. """

## Generating `Areas` and `Objectives`

Additional exploration is possible by requesting a list of areas and sub-areas from the LLM itself, and then extracting objectives from these areas, which in turn can be submitted as input to the main assistant.

### Areas

`Areas` and sub-areas can be generated by using a prompt such as `What are the main areas of employment of autonomous systems in the military?`
That produces results such as the following:

>**GPT-4 response**: Autonomous or robotic systems have become increasingly significant in military operations, providing capabilities that enhance mission effectiveness, reduce the risk to human life, and perform tasks that are either too complex, too tedious, or too dangerous for human personnel. Here are some of the main scenarios of use of such systems in the military:
>1. **Surveillance and Reconnaissance** - Robotic systems, especially drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are widely used for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. They can cover vast areas, providing real-time data and imagery without exposing human operators to danger. This capability is vital for gathering intelligence, monitoring enemy movements, and assessing battlefield conditions.
>2. **Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)** - Robots are extensively used for identifying, defusing, or safely detonating explosive devices and mines. EOD robots can navigate hazardous areas, reducing the risk to military personnel. These robots come equipped with cameras, sensors, and tools necessary for bomb disposal tasks.
>3. **Logistics and Transport** - Autonomous ground vehicles are being developed and used for logistical support, such as transporting supplies, equipment, and even wounded soldiers in and out of combat zones. These vehicles can operate in challenging terrains and environments, ensuring that human troops are well-supplied with reduced risk.
>4. **Combat Operations** - Though the use of fully autonomous lethal weapons is a subject of ethical and legal debate, there are semi-autonomous systems designed to support combat operations. These include unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and drones armed with weapons. These systems can provide support to human soldiers or serve as initial strike options where sending humans is too risky.
>5. **Search and Rescue** - In disaster zones or challenging terrains, robots and drones can be invaluable in searching for survivors, delivering emergency supplies, or assessing the damage. These systems can operate in environments that might be inaccessible or too dangerous for humans.
>6. **Electronic Warfare (EW)** - Autonomous systems are being used to conduct electronic warfare, including jamming enemy communications, deploying decoys to confuse enemy sensors, and protecting friendly forces from electronic attacks. The autonomy in these systems allows for rapid response to the dynamic EW environment.
>7. **Communication Relays** - In environments where traditional communication systems may be compromised, unmanned systems can serve as mobile communication relays, ensuring that units remain in contact. UAVs can be particularly effective in extending the range of communications in remote or challenging terrains.
>8. **Medical Evacuation and Assistance** - Autonomous systems are being explored for their potential to carry out medical evacuations or even provide frontline medical assessments and assistance. This could range from autonomous vehicles evacuating the wounded to robotic systems providing preliminary medical care.
>
>These scenarios highlight the diverse applications of autonomous and robotic systems in the military. While their use promises enhanced operational capabilities and reduced risk to human life, it also presents challenges, including ethical considerations, reliability issues, and the need for robust command and control systems to manage these advanced technologies.

### Objectives

To generate synthetic objectives, a prompt such as `What are the Objectives of use of autonomous systems for "Surveillance and Reconnaissance"`
 

>**GPT-4 results**: 
>
>The use of autonomous systems for surveillance and reconnaissance missions in the military context has several key objectives:
>
>1. **Enhanced Situational Awareness**: These systems provide real-time information and data on the battlefield or in a specific area of interest, helping commanders make informed decisions based on the most current intelligence available.
>
>2. **Persistent Surveillance**: Autonomous systems can operate around the clock, providing continuous surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities that human-operated systems might not sustain over long periods due to fatigue or operational limitations.
>
>3. **Access to Hostile or Inaccessible Areas**: Autonomous systems can be deployed in environments that are too dangerous, remote, or inhospitable for human personnel, such as conflict zones with high threats of IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices), chemical or biological hazards, or behind enemy lines.
>
>4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Using unmanned systems for surveillance reduces the risk to human life and can also be more cost-effective in the long term compared to manned missions, especially in terms of operational and maintenance costs.
>
>5. **Rapid Deployment and Scalability**: Autonomous systems can be quickly deployed and scaled up or down depending on the mission requirements, offering flexibility and adaptability to changing situations and threats.
>
>6. **Improved Accuracy and Efficiency**: Equipped with advanced sensors, AI, and machine learning algorithms, autonomous systems can analyze vast amounts of data more quickly and accurately than human analysts, identifying threats or points of interest more efficiently.
>
>7. **Stealth Operations**: Many autonomous surveillance systems are designed to operate quietly and remain undetected, allowing for covert reconnaissance missions without alerting the enemy to their presence.
>
>8. **Interoperability**: These systems are often designed to work seamlessly with other military assets, providing a comprehensive operational picture by combining data from various sources, including satellites, manned aircraft, and ground forces.
>
>9. **Preemptive Threat Identification**: The ability to constantly monitor areas of interest allows for the early identification of potential threats or enemy movements, enabling preemptive actions to be taken before a situation escalates.
>
>Ultimately, the objectives of using autonomous systems for surveillance and reconnaissance are to enhance military capabilities and effectiveness while reducing risks to human operators, providing commanders with superior information and strategic advantages in both conventional and asymmetric warfare scenarios.
