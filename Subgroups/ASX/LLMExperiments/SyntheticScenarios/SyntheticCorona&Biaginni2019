# Synthetic scenario

To test the LLM's ability to synthesize a scenario similar to what might be extracted from an exiting paper, the lines describing `Objectives` and `Context` were copied from the of Corona & Biaginni (2019) paper and submitted as input to the [synthesizing assistant](./README.md).

>*Mission for protecting the troops and populations against hostile UAxS in modern urban environment. A team of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) escorts a human platoon in a city while a swarm of unmanned air vehicles (UAV) performs a reconnaissance of the area searching for threats. As soon as hostile air C2SIM Operationalization Extended to Autonomous Systems drones show up, UAVs generate reports on enemy activity for UGVs which activate a two levels defensive system based on a safety bubble where, according to the proximity of the threat, the countermeasures increase from non-kinetic (jamming or capturing) to kinetic (shooting).*

>**Summary Narrative**
>The proposed scenario involves an orchestrated mission to safeguard troops and civilian populations in a modern urban setting from hostile unmanned aerial systems (UAxS). It incorporates a blend of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to form a comprehensive defense strategy. The UGVs serve as escorts to a human platoon, offering ground support and establishing a defensive perimeter. Concurrently, UAVs are deployed for aerial reconnaissance, tasked with identifying and tracking enemy robotic units. Upon detection of threats, these UAVs relay pertinent information back to the UGVs, triggering a tiered defense protocol that scales from non-kinetic to kinetic countermeasures based on the threat's proximity. This strategy not only aims to neutralize threats but also to collect data for an external decision-making support tool, enhancing future situational awareness and response strategies.

>**Specific Goals**
>1.	*Detection and Identification*: UAVs will employ advanced sensors to detect, track, and identify enemy UAxS, focusing on real-time threat assessment.
>2.	*Situational Awareness*: Data gathered by UAVs will be integrated into an external decision-support system, providing comprehensive situational awareness to command units.
>3.	*Defense Experimentation*: Implementation of a dual-tier defense mechanism against hostile UAxS, testing both non-kinetic (e.g., jamming, capturing) and kinetic (e.g., direct engagement) countermeasures.
>4.	*Urban Operation*: Successfully operate the UAV and UGV systems within a complex urban environment, ensuring minimal collateral damage and civilian safety.
>
>**Measures of Performance**
>- *Enemy UAxS Detection Rate*: Percentage of hostile units successfully detected by UAVs.
>- *Identification Accuracy*: Accuracy of identification systems in classifying threats.
>- *Response Time*: Time taken from threat detection to activation of appropriate countermeasures.
>- *Incident Resolution Rate*: Percentage of hostile UAxS neutralized or rendered inoperative.
>- *Collateral Damage Assessment*: Quantitative measurement of unintended damage to urban infrastructure or harm to civilians.
>- *System Enduranc*e: Duration UAxS can operate without refueling or maintenance.
>
>**Scenario Steps**
>1.	*Pre-mission Configuration*: UGVs and UAVs are equipped with necessary sensors and weapons systems. The UAVs are programmed for autonomous reconnaissance with specific instructions to search for hostile UAxS signatures.
>2.	*Deployment*: The human platoon, escorted by UGVs, moves into the urban environment. UAVs take off simultaneously to commence aerial surveillance.
>3.	*Detection and Identification*: UAVs utilize onboard sensors to detect enemy UAxS, applying machine learning algorithms for rapid identification. Detected threats are categorized based on type and potential capabilities.
>4.	*Data Integration and Situational Awareness*: Information on identified threats is transmitted in real-time to the external decision-making support tool, which processes this data to augment situational awareness, providing actionable intelligence to ground units and command.
>5.	*Activation of Defensive Measures*: Upon receiving threat notifications, UGVs engage the tiered defense systemâ€”initiating with non-kinetic measures, escalating to kinetic responses as necessary, judged by the threat's proximity and behavior.
>6.	*Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation*: UAVs persist in surveillance, adapting flight patterns based on emerging threats or environmental changes, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
>7.	*Post-Mission Analysis*: Data from the operation are analyzed to assess performance metrics, allowing refinement of tactics and technology for future missions.
