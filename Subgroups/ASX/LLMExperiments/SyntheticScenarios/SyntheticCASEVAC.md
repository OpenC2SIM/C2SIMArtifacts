>*Objectives:* 
>- *Safely transport an injured warfighter to medical evacuation point using unmanned ground vehicles, reducing risk to additional personnel*
>- *Coordinate autonomous systems to achieve a task* 
>
>*Context:*
>
>*Two UGVs are used in coordination to transport an injured warfighter to a medical evacuation point: a scouting UGV and a Medical Transport UGV. The scouting UGV travels to the medical evacuation point, identifying a safe route. Upon encountering an obstacle (such as a broken bridge), or upon receiving information about a potential threat (suspected IED along a road), the scout autonomously plans an alternative route, taking into consideration the requirements of the Medical Transport UGV. When the scout successfully arrives at the medical evacuation point, it relays the route to the Medical Transport UGV, which then navigates through that route carrying the injured warfighter.*

>**Summary Narrative**
>
>In the scenario, two unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) work in tandem to achieve the critical task of transporting an injured warfighter to a medical evacuation point, optimizing safety and minimizing risks to additional personnel. The operation leverages the capabilities of a scouting UGV and a Medical Transport UGV. The scout is tasked with route reconnaissance, identifying safe paths, and circumventing obstacles and potential threats. Once a secure route is established and validated, this information is communicated to the Medical Transport UGV, which then executes the mission by transporting the injured warfighter along the cleared path. This strategic use of autonomous systems demonstrates an integration of technology to ensure mission success while safeguarding human life.
>
>**Specific Goals**
>
>1. **Route Reconnaissance and Safety Assurance**: The scouting UGV must identify a safe and efficient route to the medical evacuation point, adapting to dynamic ground realities like terrain obstacles and threats.
>  
>2. **Effective Communication and Coordination**: The autonomous systems must maintain a reliable communication link to share critical information, such as route data and threat intelligence, ensuring synchronized operations.
>
>3. **Injury-Sensitive Transport**: The Medical Transport UGV, leveraging its design and autonomous navigation capabilities, must safely transport the injured warfighter, taking care to mitigate any factors that could exacerbate injuries.
>
>**Measures of Performance**
>
>- **Time to Evacuation**: The duration from mission initiation to the safe arrival of the injured warfighter at the medical evacuation point.
>  
>- **Route Safety and Efficiency**: Assessment of the route based on the absence of threats encountered and the minimization of transport time without compromising safety.
>  
>- **Communication Reliability**: Frequency of successful data transmissions between the UGVs, indicating effective coordination.
>  
>- **Injury Aggravation Avoidance**: Monitoring the injured warfighter's condition during transport to ensure that no additional harm is caused.
>
>**Scenario Steps**
>
>1. **Pre-Mission Configuration and Launch**: The scouting UGV is pre-configured with the mission parameters and launched to perform the initial reconnaissance of the area leading to the medical evacuation point.
>
>2. **Dynamic Threat Assessment and Route Optimization**: Utilizing sensors and AI algorithms, the scouting UGV evaluates the environment for obstacles and potential threats, dynamically adjusting its path to ensure the safest route.
>
>3. **Communication and Route Finalization**: Upon successful arrival at the evacuation point and route verification, the scouting UGV transmits the finalized safe route data to the Medical Transport UGV.
>
>4. **Medical Transport UGV Deployment**: With the route information received, the Medical Transport UGV initiates its mission carrying the injured warfighter, following the scouted path. The UGVâ€™s systems ensure that the ride is adjusted to prevent injury aggravation.
>
>5. **Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment**: Both UGVs continuously monitor their environments and system statuses. In case of emergent threats or changing conditions, the scout may need to relay updated routing information to the transport UGV en route.
>
>6. **Safe Arrival and Mission Completion**: The Medical Transport UGV safely delivers the injured warfighter to the designated medical evacuation point, where human medical personnel take over.
