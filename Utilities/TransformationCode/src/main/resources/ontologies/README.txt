Ontology-related products are posted to the SISO Digital Library under the C2SIM PDG/PSG space in folder “_C2SIM PDG Products/Ontologies".
The full set of products and supporting artifacts in the folder are described below (files are listed in alphabetical order as they appear in the Digital Library).

C2SIM_LOX_v1.0.0: C2SIM Land Operations Extension (LOX) ontology rendered in the RDF/XML format.

C2SIM_SMX__LOX_v1.0.0: An xsd (XML Schema Document) generated from the merged C2SIM core, SMX, and LOX ontologies (merged using the Stanford Protégé ontology editing tool and rendered in the RDF/XML format) by using the C2SIMOntologyToC2SIMSchemaV1.0.0 extensible stylesheet language transformations (XSLT) file.

C2SIM_SMX_v1.0.0: C2SIM Standard Military Extension (SMX) ontology rendered in the RDF/XML format.

C2SIM_v1.0.0: C2SIM Core ontology rendered in the RDF/XML format.

C2SIMAlphabetize1.0.0beta: A zip file containing a software tool to post-process output of the XSLT transformation to alphabetize named groups and elements in the generated XML schema file.

C2SIMOntologyToC2SIMSchema_v1.0.0: An XSLT file to generate a C2SIM XML schema from a merged set of C2SIM ontologies.

README: This text file providing file descriptions and notes on final changes to the ontologies and XML schema.

NOTE: The higher ontology layers SMX and LOX require access to the lower layers (for example the Core C2SIM_v1.0.0.rdf). When using Protégé, this can be achieved by including C2SIM_SMX_v1.0.0.rdf in the same directory/folder as C2SIM_SMX_v1.0.0.rdf and C2SIM_LOX_v1.0.0.rdf. Protégé will then find the lower layers automatically.
